## 1. Structure

The choice to structure our project using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is based on the pursuit of an efficient and visually organized approach for our application. MVC divides the application into three core components: the Model, responsible for data management and business logic; the View, handling visual representation and the user interface; and the Controller, managing control logic and user interaction. This separation of responsibilities not only simplifies collaborative development but also enhances maintainability by enabling developers to work on specific parts of the project without affecting the whole. Furthermore, it facilitates code reuse, potentially speeding up development, and ensures that the application is scalable and adaptable as it evolves, resulting in a more robust and visually appealing final product. Ultimately, the choice of MVC contributes to a more efficient and successful development experience for our project.

## 2. Installation

### 2.1. Main Dependencies

**Express** 

Express is a highly popular and widely used web application framework in the Node.js ecosystem. Express simplifies the creation of web servers and APIs by providing an organized structure for handling routes, HTTP requests, and responses. It facilitates the building of efficient and scalable web applications.

```
npm install express
```

**Sequelize**

Sequelize is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library that simplifies interaction with relational databases in Node.js. Sequelize abstracts the complexity of writing SQL queries directly and allows developers to interact with the database through JavaScript models and objects. It makes creating, reading, updating, and deleting data in a SQL database more object-oriented.

```
npm install sequelize
```

**mysql2**

Database drivers are necessary for connecting and communicating with a specific database. In the context of Sequelize, you need a compatible database driver for Sequelize to connect to and manage your SQL database. In this case, mysql2 is mentioned because it is commonly used for MySQL databases. Depending on the database you are using (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.), you will need to install the corresponding driver.

```
npm install mysql2
```

Estas dependencias son esenciales para construir una aplicación de Node.js que interactúa de manera eficiente con una base de datos SQL utilizando Sequelize y para crear un servidor web o una API utilizando Express. Simplifican el desarrollo al proporcionar herramientas y abstracciones que ahorran tiempo y esfuerzo a los desarrolladores.

## 3. Usage

Once you have installed the main and secondary dependencies in your project, you can start using the Eventum backend. Here are the basic steps for using it:

### 3.1. Start the Server

To start the Eventum server, you can use the following command:

```
npm start
```

This command will start the server and get it up and running. Make sure the server is running before making any requests.

### 3.2. Make HTTP Requests

The Eventum backend exposes various API endpoints that you can use to interact with the application. Here are some examples of HTTP requests you can make:

#### Get all Events

```
GET http://localhost:3001/events/getall
```

#### Create an Event

```
POST http://localhost:3001/events/create

Body JSON:

{
    "dateTime": 10/12/2023,
    "duration_min": 60,
    "type": "event",
    "banner": "test.jpg",
    "description": "Come see the EDEM musical. Free admission!!!",
    "title": "Musical".
}
```

#### Update an Event

```
PUT http://localhost:3001/events/update/1

Body JSON:

{
    "dateTime": 12/12/2023,
    "duration_min": 90,
    "type": "event",
    "banner": "test.jpg",
    "description": "Come see the EDEM musical. Free admission!!!",
    "title": "Musical".
}
```

#### Delete an Event

```
DELETE http://localhost:3001/events/delete/1
```

If you need more information about the API, feel free to visit our [Postman documentation](https://grey-meadow-86508.postman.co/workspace/poppaBack~40055b61-3f05-4b79-852e-054c752905f0/collection/28231572-60a28a80-ae6a-46a1-a63b-db457685977e?action=share&creator=28231572&active-environment=28231572-0744ac4e-249a-4509-8a21-792b6de4c867).

## 4. Configuration

### 4.1 Database Connection

In order to establish a connection to the MySQL database, it is necessary to first configure the credentials for proper connectivity. This involves defining the database details such as the host address, username, password, and database name. All the required parameters for the connection can be found in the example.env file, and all the user needs to do is set up the connection with their own data.

### 4.2 Deployment

Our project has been deployed on the Amazon Web Service (AWS) platform due to its flexibility and reliability. It offers a wide range of services and a global infrastructure to enhance performance and availability. Here are the steps we had to take to successfully deploy the project:

1. **Assign Permissions to the PEM File**

   Use the chmod command to assign specific permissions to the PEM file located in the AWS folder of the repository. This enhances security.

2. **Connect to the EC2 Instance**

   Utilize SSH to connect to your EC2 instance. Specify the PEM key and the IP address or public domain name of the EC2 instance.

3. **Launch the Backend with PM2**

   Once connected to the EC2 instance, use PM2 to start your Node.js application as a daemon process. This ensures that the application runs in the background and automatically restarts in case of errors.

4. **Nginx Configuration**

   Configure Nginx to redirect incoming web traffic to your Node.js application. Create a configuration file in /etc/nginx/sites-available/ with the appropriate settings. Then, create a symbolic link in sites-enabled and restart Nginx to apply the changes.

### 4.3 Credentials

The project must have an .env file, which will contain all the environment variables used for both database connection and project deployment configuration. Among our files, you will find an example.env file that you can use as a template to input your own data if you wish to continue the development of this project.
